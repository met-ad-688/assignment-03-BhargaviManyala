Should I add LOT_V6_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME to the Industries table as well?
:::

* Yes, you should add LOT_V6_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME to the industries table.
* Looking at current industries table structure:
* LOT_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME
* LOT_OCCUPATION_GROUP
* Adding LOT_V6_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME makes sense because:
* Consistency: It's another occupation-related field that belongs with the other LOT (Lightcast/Labor Insight) occupation data
* Version tracking: The "V6" suggests this might be a newer or different version of the specialized occupation name
Completeness: Having all occupation-related fields in one dimension table follows good data warehousing practices

For Assignment 3 visualizations, do I also need to include LOT_V6_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME in the Job Postings table, since Iâ€™ll be plotting salaries by this field, or is it enough to keep it only in the Industries table and join every time
:::

* For Assignment 3 visualizations, you should include LOT_V6_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME directly in the Job Postings table.
* Here's why:
* Performance Benefits
* Faster queries: No need to join with industries table every time you plot salary data
* Simpler SQL/code: Direct access to the field without complex joins
* Better for iterative analysis: When creating multiple visualizations, you'll query this combination frequently

```{python}
python# With denormalization (recommended for analysis):
SELECT LOT_V6_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME, AVG(SALARY) 
FROM job_postings 
GROUP BY LOT_V6_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME

# vs. Without (requires join every time):
SELECT i.LOT_V6_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME, AVG(j.SALARY)
FROM job_postings j
JOIN industries i ON j.INDUSTRY_ID = i.INDUSTRY_ID
GROUP BY i.LOT_V6_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME

```

In Industries table, I currently have INDUSTRY_ID, NAICS_2022_6, NAICS_2022_6_NAME, SOC_5, SOC_5_NAME, LOT_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME, LOT_OCCUPATION_GROUP, and NAICS2_NAME. I am planning to remove LOT_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME and LOT_OCCUPATION_GROUP .Should I go ahead and remove just those two columns?
:::

* Yes, you can remove:
* LOT_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME (replaced by the V6 version)
* LOT_OCCUPATION_GROUP (if you don't need grouping for your analysis)
* By removing those two, your Industries table will be clean and focused:
* INDUSTRY_ID, NAICS_2022_6, NAICS_2022_6_NAME, SOC_5, SOC_5_NAME, NAICS2_NAME

n my Job Postings table, I currently have columns like TITLE_CLEAN and BODY, but for Assignment 3 I need ONET_NAME (for Q3) and EDUCATION_LEVELS_NAME (for Q4). Should I remove TITLE_CLEAN and BODY and instead add ONET_NAME and EDUCATION_LEVELS_NAME directly into the Job Postings table?
:::

* Yes, you should remove TITLE_CLEAN and BODY and add ONET_NAME and EDUCATION_LEVELS_NAME
* Benefits:
* Focused on analytics: Only columns needed for Assignment 3 visualizations
* Better performance: Smaller table size, faster queries and joins
* Clean structure: No unnecessary text data for visualization tasks
* Direct access: Both ONET_NAME and EDUCATION_LEVELS_NAME available without extra joins
* This creates a lean, analytics-focused Job Postings table perfect for your visualization requirements.
