::: {.callout}
Should I add LOT_V6_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME to the Industries table as well?
:::

* Yes, you should add LOT_V6_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME to the industries table.
* Looking at current industries table structure:
* LOT_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME
* LOT_OCCUPATION_GROUP
* Adding LOT_V6_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME makes sense because:
* Consistency: It's another occupation-related field that belongs with the other LOT (Lightcast/Labor Insight) occupation data
* Version tracking: The "V6" suggests this might be a newer or different version of the specialized occupation name
Completeness: Having all occupation-related fields in one dimension table follows good data warehousing practices

For Assignment 3 visualizations, do I also need to include LOT_V6_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME in the Job Postings table, since Iâ€™ll be plotting salaries by this field, or is it enough to keep it only in the Industries table and join every time
:::

* For Assignment 3 visualizations, you should include LOT_V6_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME directly in the Job Postings table.
* Here's why:
* Performance Benefits
* Faster queries: No need to join with industries table every time you plot salary data
* Simpler SQL/code: Direct access to the field without complex joins
* Better for iterative analysis: When creating multiple visualizations, you'll query this combination frequently

```{python}
python# With denormalization (recommended for analysis):
SELECT LOT_V6_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME, AVG(SALARY) 
FROM job_postings 
GROUP BY LOT_V6_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME

# vs. Without (requires join every time):
SELECT i.LOT_V6_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME, AVG(j.SALARY)
FROM job_postings j
JOIN industries i ON j.INDUSTRY_ID = i.INDUSTRY_ID
GROUP BY i.LOT_V6_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME
```
